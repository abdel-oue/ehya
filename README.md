# Ehya – Simple Website for Business Growth

This is a simple responsive landing page made with vanilla HTML, CSS, and Font Awesome icons. But don’t get too excited – it’s in **bad condition**, so if you’re expecting perfection, you’re in the wrong place.

## ⚙️ Features

- Fully responsive layout (kinda) (mobile + desktop)  
- Hero section with CTA and navbar  
- Features breakdown with icons  
- Testimonials section  
- Footer with links and socials that might be broken 
- Clean modern look using Google Fonts and minimal CSS

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
.
├── index.html
├── styles/
│   └── styles.css
├── assests/  
│   └── Images/
```

🧟 Folder's called `assests` instead of `assets` 'cause I was straight-up slacking. I’m not renaming 50 image paths.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdel-oue/ehya
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in any browser.  
   That's it. No build tools, no frameworks, just barebones HTML and CSS (and some random images).
